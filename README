Grails PDF Plugin
author: Aaron Eischeid

Pdf plugin allows a Grails application to generate PDFs and send them
to the browser by converting existing pages in your application to PDF
on the fly. The underlying system uses the xhtmlrenderer component from java.net
along with iText to do the rendering.

Install the plugin from the grails repositories using the grails command:
    "grails install-plugin pdf"
Or you can use the zip file on Github.
    "grails install-plugin [path/to/zip/file]"
